# SalesLoft Code Assesment

Hi,

Thanks for considering me for the Senior Software Engineer role at SalesLoft. 

If you have any questions feel free to email: [thealbertyang@gmail.com](mailto:thealbertyang@gmail)


## Demo

You can test the demo of the app deployed to Vercel: 
- Demo - [https://salesloft-code-test.vercel.app/](https://salesloft-code-test.vercel.app/)
- People API - [https://salesloft-code-test.vercel.app/api/people](https://salesloft-code-test.vercel.app/api/people)


## Setup

To get setup, run these commands:
 
- Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

- Run it locally

```sh
yarn run dev
```

## Technologies Used

- React
- Styled Components
- Next.js


## Requirements Met

- ✅ Show a list of People records that are available via the API.  Display each Person’s name, email address, and job title.
- ✅ Create a button that, when clicked, displays a frequency count of all the unique characters in all the email addresses of all the People you have access to, sorted by frequency count (the count below).
- ✅ Create a 2nd button that would show us a list of suggested possible duplicate People.  A human can tell that “benoliv@salesloft.com” and “benolive@salesloft.com” are very likely the same person with just one of the email addresses having a typo.
